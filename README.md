Skunk is a data access library for Scala + Postgres.

This library is experimental and is changing rapidly. Do not use it.

Still here? Ok.

- See the [manual](http://tpolecat.github.io/skunk) (under construction).
- The [scaladoc](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.tpolecat/skunk-core_2.12) … start with the `skunk` package, then look at `Session`.
- The [examples](modules/example/src/main/scala).

Please drop a :star: if this project interests you. I need encouragement.
